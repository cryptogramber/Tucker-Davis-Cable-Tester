# Tucker-Davis-Cable-Tester

**This is an archived project.**

Extremely quick active/passive cable tester for TDT cables â€“ useful when you have animals that view $1k+ cables as a fine delicacy. Project could be vastly improved without the overkill of a DAQ board that I used, but it was what I had sitting around at the time. Requires an Arduino Mega and a current LabVIEW (sorry.. ) installation.
